# CSCI4810Project2
In this repository I have posted my second project from my CSCI 4810 'Computer Graphics' course from the University of Georgia. This program takes as input a file of integers representing the end points "x0 y0 x1 y1" on each line. It is also able to output lines to a file in the same format.
The main purpose of the program is to implement 5 different simple transformations for these lines: basic translate, basic scale, basic rotate, general scale and general rotate.
